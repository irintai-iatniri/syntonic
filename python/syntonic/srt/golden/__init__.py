"""
SRT Golden Operations - Golden ratio measure and recursion map.

The golden ratio phi is the organizing principle of SRT. This module
provides the golden measure w(n) = exp(-|n|^2/phi) and the golden
recursion map R: n -> floor(phi*n).

Classes:
    GoldenMeasure - Golden-weighted measure on winding lattice
    GoldenRecursionMap - The golden recursion R: n -> floor(phi*n)

Functions:
    golden_measure() - Factory for GoldenMeasure
    golden_recursion() - Factory for GoldenRecursionMap
    golden_weight(n) - Quick weight computation
    apply_golden_recursion(n) - Quick recursion application
