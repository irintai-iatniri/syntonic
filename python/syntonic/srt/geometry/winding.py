"""
Winding State - Winding numbers on the T^4 torus.

A winding state |n> = |n_7, n_8, n_9, n_10> represents a configuration
of winding numbers on the internal 4-torus. These are the fundamental
quantum numbers in SRT from which all charges derive.

This module re-exports the high-performance Rust implementation from
syntonic.core. The Rust WindingState provides ~50x speedup for
enumeration operations.

Example:
    >>> from syntonic.srt.geometry import winding_state
    >>> n = winding_state(1, 2, 0, -1)
    >>> n.norm_squared
    6
    >>> n.generation
    2
