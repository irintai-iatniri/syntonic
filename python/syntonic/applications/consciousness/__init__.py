"""
Consciousness Module - Physics of consciousness from SRT.

Consciousness emerges at K = 24 (kissing number saturation) when the system
runs out of external connections and must model itself.

The Hard Problem dissolves because matter doesn't create qualia—matter is
a low-fidelity projection of high-fidelity T⁴ geometry.
