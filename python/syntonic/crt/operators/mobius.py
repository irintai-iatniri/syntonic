"""
Mobius Filter Operator.

Enforces the Number-Theoretic stability rules of the vacuum.
Specifically targets the M11 (2047) Composite Barrier.

The Mobius function mu(n) encodes the arithmetic structure of integers:
- mu(n) = 1 if n is squarefree with even number of prime factors
- mu(n) = -1 if n is squarefree with odd number of prime factors
- mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor

For SRT, dimensions with mu(n) = 0 are unstable and must be zeroed.
This prevents 4th generation matter (M11 = 2047 = 23 * 89) from stabilizing.
